User Defined Functions in Python
Introduction
Python is a powerful, high-level programming language known for its simplicity and readability. One of the fundamental aspects of Python, and any programming language, is the ability to define and use functions. Functions are essential for breaking down complex problems into manageable, reusable pieces of code. In Python, user-defined functions allow programmers to create their own functions to perform specific tasks. This report will explore the concept, creation, and usage of user-defined functions in Python.

What is a Function?
A function is a block of organized, reusable code that is used to perform a single, related action. Functions provide better modularity and a high degree of code reusability. Python has many built-in functions, such as print(), len(), and sum(), but it also allows for the creation of user-defined functions.

Creating User Defined Functions
Syntax
The syntax for defining a function in Python is as follows:
def function_name(parameters):
    """Docstring (optional)"""
    statement(s)
    return expression (optional)
